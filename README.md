# algorithms (virtual topology, routing, mobility management)

This project implements OPNET models: a virtual topology for ad hoc networks is built and maintained. Other models allow routing in ad hoc (with a tradeoff between reactive and proactive) or hybrid networks (with the adaptation of Cellular IP).
