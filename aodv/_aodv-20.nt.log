61.8116640657	810	Campus Network.3	Config.	Wireless Lan	Distance Limit Exceeded	WARNING: <NL>  The propagation delay between the two WLAN nodes of same BSS <NL>   <NL>  Campus Network.3 and <NL>  Campus Network.1 <NL>   <NL>  is greater than the maximum propagation delay allowed by  <NL>  IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard, which is 1 microsecond. Due  <NL>  to violation of this rule, a degradation of WLAN <NL>  performance is possible within the BSS of these nodes. <NL>   <NL>  This message will not be repeated even the same condition <NL>  is detected between two other WLAN nodes in the network. <NL>   <NL> SUGGESTION: <NL>  Bring these nodes closer to each so that the distance <NL>  between them is less than 300 meters if you want the <NL>  configuration of these nodes to comply with the rules of the <NL>  802.11 standard fully. <NL> 
66	20476	N/A	Config.	Event Manager	Performance	Try setting the 'event_speed_parameter' to (94300). <NL> This is a preference under the category called 'all'. <NL>  <NL> The advanced event management system in the Simulation <NL> Kernel can be tuned to maintain peak performance when <NL> simulating very large systems. Your trade-off is that <NL> higher values of event_speed_parameter require <NL> additional memory. <NL>  <NL> Optimal values depend on the type and size of models, <NL> so the value above is an estimate based on how this <NL> simulation performed. You may wish to experiment <NL> with different values and compare the simulation's <NL> performance. In general, increasing this parameter <NL> will not yield significant performance gains for small, <NL> lightly-loaded systems. <NL>
